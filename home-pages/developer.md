## Data Management APIs 

A rich set of HTTP-based API's have been developed on top of LDAP, to provide broader access to the Universal directory, using modern protocols, such as SCIM, SPML and other web services API's, are described in this section

<section>
  
  > [SCIM](/web-services-api-guide/04-scim)  
  > The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification automates user identity management between identity domains. 
  
  > [REST](/web-services-api-guide/05-rest)  
  > The REST interface supports all LDAP operations and the ability to navigate the directory tree. Wrapping these operations and the progressive disclosure capabilities that exist in LDAP directories into a REST interface opens it up to the web.
