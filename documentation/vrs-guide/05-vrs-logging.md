# VRS Logging

VRS uses log4j based on an external configuration file: <RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf/rli_log4j.conf.

Log levels used are debug, info, and error.

There are two different files generated by VRS:

1.	vrs_access log (which contains the following information – the log level required is specified in the brackets):
<br>Connection [INFO]
<br>Main commands +response [INFO]
<br>Disconnection [INFO]
<br>Access errors [ERROR]

2.	vds_server log (which contains the following information – the log level required is specified in the brackets):
<br>Network layer trace [DEBUG]
<br>Virtual engine execution trace [INFO]
<br>Execution plan [INFO]
<br>Statistics (semi join optimizer) [INFO]
<br>All errors [ERROR]

VRS log files are located in <RLI_HOME>/<instance>/logs/vrs.
