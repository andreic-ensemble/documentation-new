# VRS Overview

The VRS interface allows SQL access to RadiantOne by leveraging the included JDBC driver. The VRS JDBC driver translates SQL calls into LDAP to query RadiantOne. The only use case that VRS has currently been certified with is for reporting. It has been tested with Crystal Reports and other basic SQL clients like Squirrel and Excel. These clients allow for flexible SQL queries that can be customized to meet the requirements of the VRS syntax.

>[!warning] 
>Although VRS has only been validated with reporting clients, other usages can be possible. If you would like to discuss other use cases that could meet your needs, please contact support@radiantlogic.com or your Radiant Logic account representative.**
