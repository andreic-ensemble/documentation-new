# Account Settings

This guide provides an overview of how to update your account settings and manage your API tokens.
(**confirming with RL where these details appear/what they are used for, ie. just for display on *Users* tab? For EOC communications? Communications with RL tech support?**

**Also confirming API details, what they are used for, etc.** ).

## Getting started

From any tab in the *Admin* view, your account avatar (![image description](../images/icon-avatar.png)) will be visible in the upper right corner of the screen. To access your account settings, select the avatar icon (![image description](../images/icon-avatar.png)) which will expand the account dropdown menu. From the dropdown menu, select **Account Settings** to open the *Account Settings* screen.

### Update profile image

To update your profile image, select "Edit Avatar"... (**confirming with RL if this opens a drag and drop screen or if it just opens the user's local file system to upload, and if there are any image size limits**).

## Manage API tokens

### Create an API token

To create a new API token, select the **Generate** (![image description](images/icon-generate.png)) button located just above the *API token* input field. This will generate a unique API token that populates in the *API token* input field.

Set the API token expiration date by selecting a duration from the *Expiration Date* dropdown menu and select **Save** to create the new API token.

You will receive an expiration warning when your API token is close to expiring. A warning is displayed in your *Account Settings* next to the *Expiration Date* dropdown and ... (**confirming with RL when user receives first notification and where warnings appear**). You will receive an expiration reminder every day starting *X amount of time* before your API token is set to expire.

> **Warning:** API token expiration is a permanent action. Once a token has expired it cannot be retrieved.

To copy the API token to share, select the **Copy to Clipboard* icon (![image description](images/icon-copy.png)) located next to the *API Token* input field and proceed to share through your preferred channel.

### Delete an API token

You can delete the API token by selecting the trash bin icon (![image description](images/icon-delete.png)) also located next to the *API Token* input field.

> **Warning:** Deleting an API token is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

A confirmation message will appear to verify that you would like to delete the API token and reminding you that a new API token will need to be generated for future calls. Select **Confirm** to delete the token.

![image description](images/account-confirm-delete.png)

If the token is successfully deleted you will receive a confirmation message and the *API token* field will be empty.

You can proceed to generate a new token or exit out of *Account Settings* without generating a new token by selecting **Save**.
