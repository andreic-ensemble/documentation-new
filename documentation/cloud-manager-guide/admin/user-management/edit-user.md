# Edit a User

This guide outlines the required steps to edit the details, status, role, and environment assignments for a specific user in Environment Operations Center.

## Getting started

There are two ways to open the *Edit User* tab, either by selecting the user's name or by selecting the **Options** (**...**) menu associated with that user.

To access the *Edit User* tab by directly selecting the user, select the user name from the list of users on the *Admin* *User* tab.
