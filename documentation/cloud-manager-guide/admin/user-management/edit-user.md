# Edit a User

This guide outlines the required steps to edit a user's details, status, role, and environment assignments in Environment Operations Center.

## Getting started

There are two ways to open the *Edit User* tab, either by selecting the user's name or by selecting the **Options** (**...**) menu associated with that user.

To access the *Edit User* tab by directly selecting the user, select the user name from the list of users on the *Admin* *User* tab.

This brings you to the *Environment Access* tab in a detailed overview of the user. This view lists all the environments and associated roles assigned to the user. From the *Environment Access* tab, select the **Edit User** button to open the *Edit User* tab.

Alternatively, from the *User* tab you can select the **Options** (**...**) menu associated with the user. Select **Edit** from the dropdown menu to bypass the user detailed view and navigate directly to the *Edit User* tab.

The *Edit User* tab contains all of the same fields as the *Create User* tab. From here you can update the user's details, status, role, and environment assignments accordingly.
