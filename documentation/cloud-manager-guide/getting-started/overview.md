## Account management

A user avatar is located in the upper right corner of the *Admin* screen. Select the avatar to expand your account dropdown menu. This displays your name, email, and permissions associated with the account. 

From the dropdown menu you can navigate to your **Account Settings** (![image description](images/icon-account-settings.png)), access the **Help** (![image description](images/icon-help.png))center, or **Logout** (![image description](images/icon-logout.png)) of Environment Operations Center.

For information on managing your account settings, see the [account settings](...) guide.
