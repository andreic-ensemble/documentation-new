## Delete environment

> **Note:** Deleting an environment is a permanent action and cannot be undone once submitted.

To delete the selected environment, enter the name of the environment in the space provided and select the **Delete** button. The environment name entered must match the actual environment name exactly, otherwise you will receive an error message and will not be able to submit the delete request.
