# Update an Environment

When updates are applied to your Cloud Manager instance, your environments are not automatically updated. This guide outlines the steps required to update your environments. (**This still needs to be confirmed/there may be other update conditions**)

> **Important notes before getting started.**

Quick linking to other docs.

## Managing environment updates

When an environment requires updating, an **Update Now** message appears next to the environment's version number.

### Begin updating

There are two options to begin the process to update an environment, either from the options menu (**...**) or by selecting the **Update Now** message.

To update using the options menu, locate the environment you would like to update and select the corresponding ellipsis to display the environment's options menu. From the menu select **Update** to open the Update Environment dialog box.

Alternatively, you can locate the environment you would like to update and directly select the **Update Now** message located next to the environment's version number. This will open the Update Environment dialog box.

### Update version number and nodes

Once you have started the environment update workflow, a dialog box appears containing the fields required to update the environment version and number of FID nodes. To update your environment, you must provide the correct version number that corresponds with your current version number of Cloud Manager and teh number of FID nodes to display.

To update your version number, select the correct number from the **Version** drop down menu. Your currently installed version number is displayed just above the dropdown menu for reference.

To set the number of FID nodes to display for the environment, use the provided slider to increase or decrease the quantity. Alternatively, you can select either the minus or plus sign on either side of the slider to increase or decrease the number of FID nodes to display.

Once you have set the correct version number and number of FID nodes, select **Update** to begin updating the environment.
