# Delete an Environment

This guide outlines the required steps to delete an environment in Environment Operations Center.

[!note] Only non-production environments can be deleted by users. To delete a production environment, please contact Radiant Logic.

## Select the environment

From the *Environments* home screen, locate the environment you would like to delete from the list of environments. Select the ellipsis (**...**) located within the environment's row to expand the **Options** dropdown menu. From the **Options** menu, select **Delete** to open the delete environment confirmation dialog.

## Delete environment

[!note] Deleting an environment is a permanent action and cannot be undone once submitted.

To delete the selected environment, enter the name of the environment in the space provided and select the **Delete** button. The environment name entered must match the actual environment name exactly, otherwise you will receive an error message and will not be able to submit the delete request.
