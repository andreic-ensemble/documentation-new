# Identity Data Analysis

The RadiantOne Identity Data Analysis tool analyzes the quality of data in the backends, helping you determine which attributes would be the best candidates for correlation rules. 

The Identity Data Analysis tool generates a report for each of your data sources. These reports give you a glimpse of your existing data and provide insight on the quality of your data and what is available for you to use for correlation logic. 

For details on Identity Data Analysis, see the RadiantOne Data Analysis Guide.
