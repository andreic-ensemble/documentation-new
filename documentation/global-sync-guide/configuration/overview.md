# Overview

The high-level steps to configure synchronization are the following:

1. [Data sources](data-sources.md) - connections for the servers that you want to sync data from/to.
1. [Configure virtual views](synchronization-topologies.md#mount-virtual-views-of-objects) of data sources that you want to sync data from/to.
1. [Extend RadiantOne LDAP schema](synchronization-topologies.md#extend-radiantone-ldap-schema) with any missing object class definitions (associated with the objects to be synchronized).
1. [Create topologies](synchronization-topologies.md#create-topologies) – graphical representation of the synchronization flows.
1. Configure Pipelines – [capture connector](capture-connector/capture-connector-configuration.md), [transformation](transformation/transformation-configuration.md) and [apply connector](rules/overview.md).
