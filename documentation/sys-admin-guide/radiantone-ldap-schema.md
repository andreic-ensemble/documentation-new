# RadiantOne LDAP Schema

The schema details described in this section apply to the entire RadiantOne platform.

The default schema is contained in two LDIF files.  They are, ldapschema_00.ldif and ldapschema_01.ldif.  These files are stored in the directory of <RLI_HOME>/<instance_name>/conf.  Radiant Logic specific object classes and attributes found in these files are assigned identifiers (oid) prefixed with 1.3.6.1.4.1.40747.1.X for attributes and 1.3.6.1.4.1.40747.2.X for object classes.

><span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTE – If you have WebSphere configured to use RadiantOne as the LDAP security directory, and RadiantOne is accessing an Active Directory server backend, you must extend the RadiantOne LDAP schema with all objects and attributes from the Active Directory schema. Otherwise, you can encounter problems with WebSphere not being able to properly get group membership. For detailed steps, please see below.  You must already have established a connection to Active Directory before following the steps in the Extending the RadiantOne LDAP Schema section.**

## Extending the RadiantOne LDAP Schema

You can extend the schema in three different ways.  Each is summarized below and further described in its own section after. 
-	Adding an LDIF file that contains the new object classes and attributes to the <RLI_HOME>\<instance_name>\conf directory. This file should be named ldapschema_<2 digit number greater than the existing file names>.ldif. After restarting the RadiantOne service, the new schema information is loaded into the server.
-	Extending the Schema with Objects and Attributes Contained in .orx files.
-	Creating new object classes and attributes in the Main Control Panel.

Extending RadiantOne Schema with Objects and Attributes from an LDIF File

The LDIF file should be properly named, formatted, and saved to the following location on the RadiantOne leader node:
<RLI_HOME>/<instance_name>/conf	(default instance_name is vds_server)
View the contents of the existing schema files in this location to understand the format required for the LDIF file and make sure your LDIF file follows this format.
The name of the LDIF file should be ldapschema_<any 2 digit number greater than the existing file names>.ldif.  For example, the following schema files already exist by default: ldapschema_00.ldif, ldapschema_01.ldif, and ldapschema_05.ldif, so a new schema file could be ldapschema_03.ldif (any unused 2 digit number could be used).	

><span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTES – If an object class or attribute is defined in multiple ldapschema files numbered between ldapschema_00.ldif and ldapschema_49.ldif, the ldapschema file with the largest number will override the definition in lower numbered files. For example, if an object class named domain is defined in both ldapschema_01.ldif and ldapschema_10.ldif, the definition from ldapschema_10.ldif is used.**

The ldapschema_50.ldif is a special file generated from .orx schema definitions. If an object class or attribute is defined in multiple ldapschema files numbered between ldapschema_50.ldif and ldapschema_98.ldif, the ldapschema file with the largest number will override the definition in the lower numbered files but will not override any definition in files numbered between ldapschema_00.ldif through ldapschema_49.ldif. For example, ldapschema_90.ldif would override ldapschema_50.ldif, but would not override a definition in ldapschema_48.ldif.

The ldapschema_99.ldif overrides all previous definitions in ldapschema_00-98.ldif.

As long as RadiantOne and ZooKeeper are running on the leader node machine where you add the LDIF file, the schema file takes effect after the RadiantOne on all nodes are restarted. 

Extending the RadiantOne Schema with Objects and Attributes Contained in .orx Files

The metadata from any backend that is virtualized by RadiantOne is maintained in a file with a .orx extension. All .orx files are shown in the Main Control Panel -> Settings Tab -> Configuration section, when the ORX Schema node is selected.  If you extracted a new schema, and it does not appear in the list, click the Refresh List button. To add the object classes and attributes contained in a file to the RadiantOne LDAP schema, check the Publish in Server Schema option next to the proper .orx file.  After all schema files have been selected, click the Generate LDAP Schema button.



Figure 1: ORX Files Available for Extending RadiantOne LDAP Schema

The object classes and attributes contained in the select files are added to the RadiantOne LDAP schema and can be viewed from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Configuration section, LDAP Schema node.

>**Note – if you have already added object classes and attributes from some .orx files, then they automatically have a check mark in the Publish in Server Schema column.  If you want them removed from the RadiantOne LDAP schema, uncheck them before clicking the Generate LDAP Schema button.**

Extending the RadiantOne Schema with New Objects and Attributes from the Main Control Panel

Object classes and attributes can be manually defined from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Configuration section > LDAP Schema.

Figure 2: Manually Defining New Object Classes and Attributes

Create New Object Class

1.	Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Configuration section > LDAP Schema node.

2.	On the right side, a list of object classes that currently comprise the RadiantOne LDAP schema is displayed.

3.	Click **Add** at the bottom.

4.	Enter a name for the object class, parent (if it inherits from an existing object class), and OID (optional). Using the left and right arrow buttons, declare which attributes are required and which are optional.  

5.	An auxiliary object class is one that does not define the core type of an entry, but defines additional characteristics of that entry. If the object class you are creating should be auxiliary, check the Auxiliary Object Class option.

6.	Click **OK** to add the new object class to the RadiantOne LDAP schema.

Create New Attribute

1.	Go to the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Configuration section > LDAP Schema node.

2.	On the right side, select the Attributes tab.

3.	Click on the Add button at the bottom.

4.	Enter new attribute name, OID (optional), attribute aliases (optional), description (optional), and syntax (from the drop-down list).

5.	Check whether the attribute allows multi-values.

6.	Click Ok to add the new attribute to the RadiantOne LDAP schema.

Requesting the Schema Associated with Entries - subschemaSubentry

The subschemaSubentry attribute is an operational attribute that is returned by RadiantOne for every entry in the directory when it is specifically requested. The value of the subschemaSubentry attribute is the DN of the entry that contains schema information for this entry. An example of an LDAP search with subschemaSubentry requested is shown below.



Figure 3: Requesting subschemaSubentry

Schema Extensions for Select Access v6.0 Integration

Schema extensions are required for Select Access to work with RadiantOne.  Make sure that the RadiantOne service is stopped. Copy the two files from <RLI_HOME>/vds_server/schema_extension into <RLI_HOME>/vds_server/conf.  Restart the RadiantOne service.
