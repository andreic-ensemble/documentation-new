# Other Custom Authentication Providers

Using the Custom Authentication Provider framework, Radiant can support other MFA solutions as well (e.g. PingID, Google Authenticatorâ€¦etc.). These customizations are implemented by the Radiant Logic Solution Integrator team via professional services. If the 2nd factor is a form of code/one-time password that can be appended to the password in the bind (by the client app) and RadiantOne FID can call a service to validate the code, then we should be able to support it. If you are interested in integrating with an MFA solution, contact your Radiant Logic Account Representative to discuss the use case.
